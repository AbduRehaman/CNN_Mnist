# Convolutional Neural Network Tutorial
Hi! Thanks for checking out my tutorial where I walk you through the process of coding a convolutional neural network in java from scratch. After building a network for a university assignment, I decided to create a tutorial to (hopefully) help others do the same and improve my own understanding of neural networks. 

To run this code, please download the CSV mnist data replace the filepath variables in the main function to match your CSV directory.
